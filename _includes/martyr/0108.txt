At Beauvais, in France, the holy martyrs Lucian, priest, Maximian and Julian.
The last two were killed with the sword by the persecutors, but blessed

the name of Christ openly, received the same sentence of death.&mdash;Also, St. Eugenian, 
martyr.&mdash;In Lybia, the holy martyrs Theophilus, deacon, and Helladius, who, 
after being lacerated and cut with sharp pieces of earthenware, were cast into the 
fire, and rendered their souls to God.&mdash;At Venice, the demise of blessed Lawrence 
Justinian, confessor, first patriarch of that city. Eminent for learning, and abundantly 
filled with the heavenly gifts of divine wisdom, he was ranked among the Saints by 
Alexander VIII. He is again mentioned on the 5th of September.&mdash;At Hierapolis, 
in Asia, St. Apollinaris, bishop, who was conspicuous for sanctity and learning, 
under Marcus Antoninus Verus.&mdash;At  Naples, in Campania, the birthday of the 
bishop St.  Severin, brother to the blessed martyr Victorinus, who, after working 
many miracles, went to rest, replenished with virtues and merits.&mdash;At Pavia, 
St. Maximus, bishop and confessor.&mdash;At Metz, St. Patiens, bishop.&mdash;The 
same day, among the inhabitants of Noricum (now Austria), the abbot St. Severin,

his body was carried to Lucullanum, near Naples, and thence transferred to the monastery of St. Severin.
