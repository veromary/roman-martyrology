About
=====

<p>Some versions of the Divine Office involved reciting a list of the saints to be commemorated.  The one I am familiar with asks for tomorrows saints to be remembered at Prime, the first hour of the day, roughly 6am.</p>

<p>There are scanned in versions of the Roman Martyrology in the Internet Archive, but I thought it would be handy to have a javascript version that pulled in the listing for the day's saint automatically.</p>

<p>There are other Saint of the Day webpages which are awesome - especially <a href="http://saints.sqpn.com/today-on-the-calendar/">http://saints.sqpn.com/today-on-the-calendar/</a> - but not so easy to read out as the Martyrology books which are specially made for that purpose.</p>

<p>I am endeavouring to keep ahead of the current day as we go through the year.  I'm using OCR on <a href="https://archive.org/details/romanmartyrology00cathuoft">https://archive.org/details/romanmartyrology00cathuoft</a> which I have also set up as <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/benedict-xiv/roman-martyrology/paperback/product-21821878.html">a paperback on Lulu</a>.</p>

<h2>Embeddable widget</h2>

<p>Laura Gibbs of <a href="http://bestlatin.blogspot.com">Best Latin</a> commissioned a handy tool called <a href="http://rotatecontent.com">Rotate Content</a>.  I've used it to make this widget:</p>

<div style="outline: 1px dotted black; width: 30em; max-width: 90%; padding: 0 2% 0 2%; margin-left: auto ; margin-right: auto ; ">
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ site.url }}/js/rotate.js"></script>
</div>

If you would like to embed this script into your webpage:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://roman-martyrology.brandt.id.au/js/rotate.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
