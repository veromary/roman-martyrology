AT Rome, near the spot called Ursus Pileatus, St. 
Candidus, martyr.&mdash;The same day the holy martyrs Denis, Faustus, Cains, Peter, Paul, and four 
others, who suffered much under Decius; and under 
Valerian, being a long time subjected to torments by 
the governor AEmilian, merited the palm of martyrdom.&mdash;Among the ancient Saxons (in Westphalia), 
two holy martyrs of the name of Ewaldus, who being priests and preaching Christ in that country, 
were seized by the Pagans and put to death. During the night a great light appeared for a long time 
over their bodies, showing where they were, and how 
distinguished were their merits.&mdash;In Africa, St. 
Maximian, bishop of Bagay, who, after having frequently endured great cruelties from the Donatists, 
was finally cast headlong from a high tower, and 
left for dead. Illustrious by a glorious confession, 
he afterwards rested in the Lord.&mdash;In Palestine, St. 
Hesychius, confessor, disciple of St. Hilarion, and 
the companion of his travels.&mdash;In Belgium, in the 
diocese of Namur, St. Gerard, abbot.
