AT Rome, the holy virgin Victoria, a martyr, in the 
persecution of the emperor Decius. She had 
been promised in marriage to a pagan named Eugene, but because she refused to marry him and to 
offer sacrifice to idols, and because by working many 
miracles, she brought many virgins to the service 
of God, she was, at the request of her betrothed, 
stabbed in the heart with a sword by the executioner. 
&mdash;At Nicomedia, the birthday of twenty holy martyrs, whom the persecution of Diocletian made martyrs for the faith of Christ, after subjecting them to 
the most painful torments.&mdash;In the same place, the 
Saints Migdonius and Mardonius ; one of whom was 
burned alive in the same persecution, and the other 
died in a pit into which he had been thrown. A 
deacon of St. Anthimus, bishop of Nicomedia, suffered at the same time. He was arrested by the 
Gentiles when carrying letters to the martyrs, and 
being overwhelmed with stones, went to our Lord. 
&mdash;In Crete, the holy martyrs Theodulus, Saturninus, 
Euporus, Gelasius, Eunician, Zeticus, Cleomenes, 
Agathopus, Gelasius, and Evaristus, who were beheaded, after suffering cruel torments, in the persecution of Decius.&mdash;At Rome, blessed Servulus, of 
whom St. Gregory writes, that a paralytic from his 
early years to the end of his life, he remained lying 
in a porch near St. Clement's Church, and being invited by the chant of angels, he went to enjoy the 
glory of Paradise. At his tomb, frequent miracles 
are wrought by Almighty God.
