AT Patras, in Achaia, the birthday of the apostle 
St. Andrew, who preached the gospel of Christ 
in Thrace and Scythia. Being apprehended by the 
proconsul AEgseas, he was shut up in prison, severely 
scourged, and finally, being suspended on a cross, he 
lived two days on it, teaching the people. Having 
besought our Lord not to permit that he should be 
taken down from the cross, he was surrounded with 
a great brightness from heaven, and when the light 
disappeared he breathed his last.&mdash;At Rome, the martyrdom of the Saints Castulus and Euprepis.&mdash;At 
Constantinople, St. Maura, virgin and martyr.&mdash;Also, 
St. Justina, virgin and martyr.&mdash;At Saintes, the 
holy bishop Trojanus, a man of great sanctity, who 
shows by many miracles that he lives in heaven, 
though buried on earth.&mdash;At Rome, St. Constantius, 
confessor, who strongly opposed the Pelagians, and 
by enduring many injuries from them, gained a place 
among holy confessors.&mdash;In Palestine, blessed Zosimus, confessor, who was distinguished by sanctity 
and miracles in the time of the emperor Justin.
