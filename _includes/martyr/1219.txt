AT Alexandria, in Egypt, blessed Nemesius, martyr, 
who was first denounced before the judge as a 
robber, but on being freed from that charge, was soon 
after, in the persecution of Decius, accused before 
the judge Emilian of being a Christian. By him he 
was twice subjected to the torture, and condemned to 
be burned alive with robbers, thus bearing a resemblance to our Saviour, who was crucified with thieves.
