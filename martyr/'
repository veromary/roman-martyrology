AT ROME, two hundred and sixty holy martyrs condemned for the name of Christ.
 Claudius ordered them to dig sand beyond
the Salarian gate, and then to be shot dead
with arrows by soldiers in the amphitheatre.&mdash;Also,
the birthday of the holy martyrs Leo, Donatus, Abundantius, Nicephorus, and nine others.&mdash;At Marseilles, the holy martyrs Hermes and Adrian.&mdash;At
Heliopolis, in the persecution of Trajan, St. Eudoxia,
martyr,-who, being baptized by bishop Theodotus
and fortified for the combat, was put to the sword
by the command of the governor Vincent, and thus
received the crown of martyrdom.&mdash;The same day,
St. Antonina, martyr. For deriding the gods of the
Gentiles, in the persecution of Diocletian, she was,
after various torments, shut up in a cask and
drowned in a marsh near the city of Cea.&mdash;At
Kaiserswerth, the bishop St. Swidbert, who, in the
time of pope Sergius, preached the Gospel to the
inhabitants of Friesland, Holland, and to other Germanic peoples.&mdash;At Angers, St. Albinus, bishop and
confessor, a man of most eminent virtue and piety.&mdash;
At Le Mans, St. Siviard, abbot.&mdash;At Perugia, the
translation of St. Herculanus, bishop and martyr,
who was beheaded by order of Totila, king of the
Goths. Forty days after his decapitation his body,
as pope St. Gregory relates, was found as sound and
as firmly joined to the head as if it had never been
touched by the sword.
