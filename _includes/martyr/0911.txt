AT Rome, in the Cemetery of Basilla, on the old 
Salarian road, the birthday of the holy martyrs 
Protus and Hyacinth, brothers and eunuchs in the 
service of blessed Eugenia, who were arrested, in the 
time of the emperor Gallienus, on the charge of being Christians, and urged to offer sacrifice to the 
gods. But as they refused, both were most severely 
scourged, and finally beheaded.&mdash;At Laodicea, in 
Syria, the martyrdom of the Saints Diodorus, Diomedes, and Didimus.&mdash;At Leon, in Spain, St. Vincent, abbot and martyr.&mdash;In Egypt, the holy bishop 
Paphnutius, one of those confessors, who, under the 
emperor Galerius Maximinus, having their right eye 
plucked out and the joint of the left knee cut, were 
condemned to work in the metal mines. Afterwards, 
under Constantine the Great, he courageously combated for the Catholic faith against the Arians, and 
at length, being adorned with many crowns, rested 
in peace.&mdash;At Lyons, the demise of St. Patiens, bishop.&mdash;At Vercelli, St. AEmilian, bishop.&mdash;At Alexandria, St. Theodora, who having committed a fault 
through imprudence and repenting of it, remained 
unknown in a religious habit, and persevered until 
her death in practices of extraordinary abstinence 
and patience.
