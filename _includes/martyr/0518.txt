AT Camerino, the holy martyr Venantius, who at
fifteen years of age, with ten others, ended a
glorious combat by being beheaded under the emperor Decius and the governor Antiochus.&mdash;In
Egypt, St. Dioscorus, a lector, who was subjected by
the governor to many various torments, such as the
tearing off of his nails and the burning of his sides
with torches; but a light from heaven having prostrated the executioners, the saint finally consummated his martyrdom by having red-hot metal applied to his body.&mdash;At Spoleto, St. Felix, a bishop,
who obtained the palm of martyrdom under the emperor Maximian.&mdash;In Egypt, St. Potamon, bishop, a
confessor under Maximian Galerius, and afterwards
a martyr under the emperor Constantius, and the
Arian governor Philagrius.&mdash;At Ancyra, in Galatia,
the martyrs St. Theodotus, and the saintly virgins
Thecusa, his aunt, Alexandra, Claudia, Faina, Euphrasia, Matrona, and Julitta. They were at first
taken to a place of debauch, but the power of God
having preserved them from evil, they had stones tied
to their necks, and were plunged into a lake. For
gathering their remains and burying them honorably, Theodotus was arrested by the governor, and
after being horribly Iacerated, was put to the sword,
and thus received the crown of martyrdom.&mdash;At
Upsal, in Sweden, St. Eric, king and martyr.&mdash;At
Rome, St. Felix, confessor, of the Order of Capuchin
Minorites, celebrated for his evangelical simplicity
and charity. He was inscribed on the roll of Saints
